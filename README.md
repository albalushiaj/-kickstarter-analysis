# ****Kickstarting with Excel****
## Overview of Project
- To see how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that has already been combed through, visualizations were created for campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.
### Purpose
- Analyze the kickstarter data to determine potential factors that led to the success or failure of fundraising campaigns. 
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

-  Theater is a popular and successful type of campaign overall compared to the other campaigns, and theatre fundraising campaigns hvae a higher sucess rate if launched during the following months: May, june, and July.
- The lowest success rate to launch campaigns during the year is December. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

- Plays under the theatre category fundraising campaigns that have lower budget goals from less than $1,000 to $4,999 range have the highest success rate of above 70% (73%-76% sucess rate range).

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- For the analysis of Outcome based on Launch date, the collected data was formattted under years whilst the better viewpoint for finding patterns for launch dates were through months. Thus, there was difficulty finding the correct method to filter this out through a pivot table, and it was overcomed by adding or dropping the correct filters to get the desired table outcome. 
-  For the analysis of Outcome based on Goals, the difficulty was using the COUNTIFS formula correctly by inserting the correct criteria. At first, the numbers were far to large compared to the sample size, thus, after seeking help through some videos, the formula was corrected by adding additional criteria to only show successful goals, failed goals, etc. 
## Results
- Theater Outcomes by launch date have a higher sucess rate while launching the campaigns in May, June, and July.
- Theater Outcomes by launch Date have a lower sucess rate if launched in December
- Above 70% sucessful outcomes based on goals if the campaigns goal budget is withing the less than $1,000 to $4,999 range, and 50% success rate if the budget is under $19,999.
- The sample size of the data could have been larger mainly for the higher budget fundraising campaigns as there was limited data points. In addition, the lack of previous data for comparision since some budget ranges data points were limited, this comparision could have provided new viewpoints or actionable results. 
- How these campaigns were markerted through digital advertising, word of mouth, fliers, billboards, and other methods should have been captured. By adding this new field, we can find which method is most successful or worked best for certain campaigns which then can be visually presented through graphs.
